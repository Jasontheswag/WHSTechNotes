  precision affects the outcome of a program due to the fact that even one mistake makes the whole program not work. if steps or details are missed the entire thing of code will not work as intended or just not work. it is important to develop good habits of attention to detail early into your coding journey so you can understand specific things in coding.

  how does ai improve and harm things.
  ai could help people out by giving them ideas on stuff they could do for work. ai can make mistakes and it can be very dangerous. ai also steals.

  computer technology affects the election process by giving more people the ability to vote. it also might have the chance for some bad person to hack the vote.

  coding can improve problem solving skills by helping you be able to make your code simpler while still doing the same thing it is meant to do.

  your personal information needs to be protected so no one makes it look like you committed a crime online. I don't think I ever shared my personal information online. you can hide your identity while still communicating.

  I don't really have an idea of anything, though I guess the invention of the lightbulb did make computer screens exist, I believe. it could make computers have more and more accurate displays, having more of the small lights to display it fully, with a larger amount of pixels.

  AI image generation.
  it concerns me because it steals art.
  there is no way this could be used in my field of interest.
  it will probably need to be made so it ONLY uses submitted images that it is allowed to use.

  I'm looking forward to this winter break, I am exicted.

  computer science expectations:you should never use A.I. EVER, and you should understand how code works.

  I am interested in coding, I don't know if I really need to explain.

  I, personally, do NOT want to use A.I., sorry. but, hey, today is undertale's 10th anniversary! well, if I had to use A.I. for anything, I would use it to probably make some kind of bad joke generator, as it would probably get a good laugh out of others, and it would use samples from people who WANT it to sample their jokes.

  I believe that having virtual jobs you can do to get money is great, as long as it is done right. I don't believe Roblox is their best choice though, since, despite being the most obvious choice, roblox, itself, has been known to not care about anyone on your platform, and it wouldn't be a good idea associating yourself with said things.

  I'm not doing this, this is hell, I am in hell.

# October 14, 2025
  I don't want to use A.I. since it steals from people without credit, I honestly don't care if it is more efficient to use A.I. since I want to make everything myself.
  I'm NOT gonna use AI
  A.I. sucks lol, that's my conclusion.

  I am excited for thanksgiving break, as I get a break from being bullied, I get to eat a lot of food, and I get to talk to my family.

  If it runs out of funding, people will have trouble getting food, which could cause them to starve.

  A job that uses drones is robotics, obviously.

  Self driving cars rely on A.I., which is known to be terrible at it's job. They wouldn't be able to fully detect something like the stop light on the bus, as it is both a stop sign and a stop light, which probably confuses it. They could do something so, if it detects two next to each other, it still takes it as a stop.

  I don't have any plans for winter break besides talking to friends and eating a lot

  Autcraft exists to prevent things like people harrassing and bullying people with mental disorders.
  when developers ignore safety, people can get hurt and bullied

  When you behave professionally, you wear appropriate clothing, use family friendly, normal language, and just general actions, like walking normally and not doing some weird dance when walking.
